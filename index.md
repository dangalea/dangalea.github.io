Hi everyone! I am Daniel Glaea, currently a PhD researcher at the University of Reading applying Deep Learning Techniques to detect the presence of Tropical Cyclones with the view of reducing the amount of data written out during climate simulations.

Whenever I am not working, I like to watch sports, especially cricket, golf and boxing, as well as going to the gym or going for a walk. My current other interest is dabbling in algorithmic trading.
